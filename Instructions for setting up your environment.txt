Instructions for setting up SQL database:

1. Launch the MySQL console from the WAMPServer menu. When it prompts for a password just hit enter, as the password
is currently nothing
2. Create the database:

create database chess_game;

3. Switch to the database. Do this everytime you start the console:

use chess_game;

4. Create the table. There is only one table for this project:

create table user_information (
	firstName varchar(20),
	lastName varchar(20),
	password varchar(20),
	email varchar(30),
	pvpWins int default 0,
	pvpDraws int default 0,
	pvpGamesPlayed int default 0,
	aiWins int default 0,
	aiDraws int default 0,
	aiGamesPlayed int default 0
);

To query this table, use:

select * from user_information;

5. Populate the table with dummy information. Main purpose is to view the leaderboards or login without having to
take the time to sign up.

insert into user_information values ("admin", "admin", "12345678", "email@uregina.ca", 5, 2, 10, 2, 0, 6);
insert into user_information values ("dummy1", "dummy1", "12345678", "email@uregina.ca", 3, 0, 20, 5, 0, 10);
insert into user_information values ("dummy2", "dummy2", "12345678", "email@uregina.ca", 1, 10, 11, 1, 3, 4);
insert into user_information values ("dummy3", "dummy3", "12345678", "email@uregina.ca", 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 15);




Accessing the webpage:

To access our "production" webpage, use the following url. Note it is not secured:

http://64.201.206.165:8080

When making your own:

Can just access with localhost.
Make sure to change the landing page to be Chess_LoginPage.php:
	- go to file apache httpd.config
	- find line that says DirectoryIndex
	- add Chess_LoginPage.php to the right of the list of indexes
	- restart all services and attempt to access localhost again
	- make sure to change the name of index.html in your www directory to be something different (like old_index.html) or remove
	it from the list in apache, whichever

Add all pertinent files from github into the www directory (C:\wamp64\www for me)
	- bear in mind that the location of the files is important, you may need to rearrange things or change hrefs
	for the time being to make things work until we decide for sure on what the exact file paths should be
	- to make things work for now easiest thing to do is remove all files and folders from both ChessBoard file
	and Login and Signup file and dump them in www (eg path is www/PVP/ or www/img/, etc.) and that shouldn't
	break any links
