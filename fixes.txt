	- merge winValidation in moveValidation
	- make appropriate changes to object diagrams as necessary
component diagram
	- update file names
	- add socket io and david cares stuff
deployment diagram
	- update for migration to azure
	- change protocols, servers
	- Mississauga

code test cases (5 each)
	- correctness
		- user sign up and login
		- player enters online room and play against another player
		- real time chess
		- player plays against the CPU
		- leaderboard correctly updates each win
	- robustness
		- form input validation
		- reject incorrect moves
		- cannot enter someone else's chess game (and 'help')
		- cannot effect opponent moves 
		- player cannot exit match to resign without it being recorded as a loss
		(?)
	- performance
		- moves of the cpu do not take more than 2 seconds to process
			- proportional to difficulty level
		- minimal wait time when joining a pvp game
		- pvp minimal wait time for moves with the opponent
		- pvp time to alert player of opponent leaving
		- time to alert player of game over
